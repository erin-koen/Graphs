BFS and DFS should be memorized. We're going to be using them over and over again. It's never going to be exactly the same, variances based on types of data, shape of the graph, etc. Memorize the baseline and have a strong understanding of it. Memorize key principles AND lines of code. 

Need to be able to transcribe a written spec into code.

Solving Graph Problems:
- translate it into graph terminology
- build your graph
- traverse it

Dense - high proporition of nodes to edges. 
Sparse - low proportion of nodes to edges. 

Cyclic graph - any graph in which you can follow edges and move into a node that's already been inspected.

Acyclic graph - a graph in which the above is impossible. Most trees are acyclic graphs. 

Directed Acyclic Graphs - One way edges. No cycles. 

Adjacency matrices are good for dense graphs rather than sparse graphs. <-- This would make more sense if i'd paid attn for the last 20 min. 

A search is a traversal that stops when the target value is found.
